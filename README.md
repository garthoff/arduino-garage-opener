arduino-garage-opener
=====================

My [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)-based garage door opener allows me to control my garage door from my iPhone.  It makes use of the [Teleduino](http://www.teleduino.org/) service.

For security reasons the Teleduino API key is not included in the source.  Instead it is prompted for and stored in a cookie. 

More information to come.
