=====================

My [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)-based garage door opener allows me to control my garage door from my iPhone.  It makes use of the [Teleduino](http://www.teleduino.org/) service.  

For security reasons the Teleduino API key is not included in the source.  Instead it is prompted for and stored in a cookie. 

More information to come. For now, here are some pictures.

Reset button, green LED (for Teleduino status), yellow LED (shows closed switch for large garage door) and red LED (shows closed switch for small garage door). Also a buzzer on the side which for now is just for fun, but I plan to have it buzz as a warning that the door is about to be remotely activated.
